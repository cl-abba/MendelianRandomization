# MendelianRandomization
Mendelian Randomization scripts

This repository describes steps in Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses. Compliment to the paper, "Investigating potential causal relationships between pigmentation genetics and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease".

## Introduction

## Materials and methods

To replicate this protocol, the following materials are required:

1. Summary statistics for traits of interest
2. R/R studio, as well as storage and workspace that can be used to storing output files, running jobs and downloading programs

The methodology is as follows:

1. LDSC (GenomicSEM)
2. PGS (PRSice version 1.25)
3. MR (TwoSample MR)
4. Gene set enrichment (FUMA and ShinyGo)
