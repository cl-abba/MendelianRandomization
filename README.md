# Shared Genetic Architecture 
Scripts for investigating shared genetic architecuture (correlative relationships, causal inference and pleiotropy).

This repository describes steps in Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses. Compliment to the paper, "Investigating shared genetic architecture between pigmentation genetics and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease".

## Introduction

## Materials and methods

To replicate this protocol, the following materials are required:

1. Summary statistics for traits of interest
2. R/R studio, as well as storage and workspace that can be used to storing output files, running jobs and downloading programs

The methodology is as follows:

1. LDSC (GenomicSEM)
2. PGS (PRSice version 1.25)
3. MR (TwoSample MR and MRAPPS)
4. CPASSOC (http://hal.case.edu/zhu-web/)
5. Gene set enrichment (FUMA https://fuma.ctglab.nl/ and ShinyGo http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go74/)
