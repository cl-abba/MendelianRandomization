# Determination of genetic correlation with LDSC 

- The largest available set of summary statistics for PD was utilized in this study (Nalls et al., 2019), as well as publicly available summary statistics for basal cell carcinoma, brown hair, melanoma, nevi, red hair, skin color, tanning response, vitamin D level, and vitiligo.
- Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) (Bulik-Sullivan et al., 2015) was used to estimate genetic correlation between PD and the nine pigmentation-related phenotypes.
- All P-values were adjusted using a Bonferroni multiple testing correction.
